# Lease Lens Project - Development Status

## Project Overview
**Lease Lens** is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload PDF lease agreements for AI-powered analysis. The AI identifies potential red flags, provides plain English summaries, and suggests questions to ask landlords.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI framework
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **AI Service**: Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro)
- **PDF Processing**: PyMuPDF (fitz)
- **Architecture**: Decoupled two-directory structure (`api/` and `client/`)

## What Has Been Completed ✅

### Backend (api/ directory)
- **`requirements.txt`**: All Python dependencies defined
  - fastapi, uvicorn, python-multipart, PyMuPDF, google-generativeai, python-dotenv, fastapi-cors
- **`.env`**: Environment file with placeholder for Google API key
- **`main.py`**: Complete FastAPI application with:
  - CORS configuration for frontend communication
  - Google AI client setup with error handling
  - Master prompt for lease analysis (structured output format)
  - `/analyze` endpoint for PDF upload and processing
  - PDF text extraction using PyMuPDF
  - AI analysis with comprehensive error handling

### Frontend (client/ directory)
- **Next.js Application**: Bootstrapped with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
- **`package.json`**: Updated with required dependencies (axios, react-markdown)
- **`src/app/page.tsx`**: Complete React component with:
  - File upload functionality (PDF only)
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Loading states with spinner animation
  - Axios integration for API communication
  - ReactMarkdown for rendering AI analysis results
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
  - Professional UI with proper styling

## What Remains Outstanding ⚠️

### Critical Setup Requirements
1. **Google AI API Key**: The `.env` file contains a placeholder. A valid Google AI API key needs to be obtained from Google AI Studio and inserted.

2. **Python Dependencies Installation**: Backend dependencies need to be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Node.js Dependencies Installation**: Frontend dependencies need to be installed via `npm install` (note: there were npm cache permission issues during development that may need resolution)

### Known Issues
- **npm Cache Permissions**: During development, there were npm cache ownership issues that required `sudo chown -R 501:20 "/Users/arise/.npm"` to resolve
- **Package Installation**: Frontend dependencies (axios, react-markdown) were added to package.json but not yet installed due to npm permission issues

## Next Steps (In Priority Order)

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix npm permissions** (if still present):
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R 501:20 "/Users/arise/.npm"
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd api/
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Frontend
   cd ../client/
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Google AI API Key**:
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Generate an API key
   - Replace `PASTE_YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE` in `api/.env`

4. **Test the application**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd api/
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd client/
   npm run dev
   ```

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Add more specific error messages for different failure scenarios
   - Implement retry logic for API failures
   - Add file size validation

2. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Add file preview before analysis
   - Implement progress indicators during analysis
   - Add ability to save/export analysis results

3. **Security & Performance**:
   - Add input validation and sanitization
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add file size limits
   - Consider adding user authentication

4. **Testing & Documentation**:
   - Add unit tests for both backend and frontend
   - Create API documentation
   - Add user guide/help section

## API Endpoints
- **POST `/analyze`**: Accepts PDF file upload, returns AI analysis
  - Content-Type: multipart/form-data
  - Response: JSON with analysis markdown

## Environment Variables
- **GOOGLE_API_KEY**: Required for Google Generative AI service

## Development Commands
```bash
# Backend server
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend server
npm run dev

# Frontend build
npm run build
```

## Notes for Next Development Session
- The application is functionally complete but requires setup steps
- All core features are implemented according to the original specification
- The AI prompt is optimized for lease analysis with structured output
- CORS is properly configured for localhost development
- The UI is responsive and professional with proper loading states
- Error handling covers common scenarios (no file, invalid file type, API errors)
