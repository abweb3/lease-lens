# Lease Lens Project - Development Status

## Project Overview
**Lease Lens** is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload PDF lease agreements for AI-powered analysis. The AI identifies potential red flags, provides plain English summaries, suggests questions to ask landlords, and offers negotiation tips.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI framework
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **AI Service**: Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro) - **UPGRADED 2025**
- **PDF Processing**: PyMuPDF (fitz)
- **Architecture**: Decoupled two-directory structure (`api/` and `client/`)
- **Repository**: GitHub - https://github.com/abweb3/lease-lens.git

## What Has Been Completed ✅

### Backend (api/ directory)
- **`requirements.txt`**: All Python dependencies defined
  - fastapi, uvicorn, python-multipart, PyMuPDF, google-generativeai, python-dotenv, fastapi-cors
- **`.env`**: Environment file configured with Google API key
- **`main.py`**: Complete FastAPI application with:
  - CORS configuration for frontend communication
  - Google AI client setup with error handling
  - **Enhanced master prompt** for comprehensive lease analysis
  - `/analyze` endpoint for PDF upload and processing
  - PDF text extraction using PyMuPDF
  - **Advanced retry logic** with exponential backoff for rate limiting
  - **Intelligent error handling** for API failures
  - **Gemini 2.5 Pro integration** with enhanced reasoning capabilities

### Frontend (client/ directory)
- **Next.js Application**: Bootstrapped with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
- **`package.json`**: Updated with required dependencies (axios, react-markdown)
- **`src/app/page.tsx`**: Complete React component with:
  - File upload functionality (PDF only)
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Loading states with spinner animation
  - Axios integration for API communication
  - ReactMarkdown for rendering AI analysis results
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
  - Professional UI with proper styling

### Development Environment
- **Python Virtual Environment**: Created and configured (`api/venv/`)
- **Dependencies**: All backend and frontend dependencies installed
- **Git Repository**: Initialized and pushed to GitHub
- **Servers**: Both backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 3000) running successfully
